	`He vouched for you at the bank so you could take a pretty big loan and even gave you a ride to Tarazed to buy a 'Sunder', equipped for asteroid mining. You felt like you were back in school when Ted helped you learn enough to qualify for your pilot's license.`

The Ascella system is only a short journey away and, as Ted explained to, is home to asteroids containing more expensive ores. `

When he moved closer to get a better look at the phenomenon, his ship somehow got sucked into it. In the next moment all stars around him have changed.
